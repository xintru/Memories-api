# STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

## UPD 17.01.21: Decided to rework the idea of the project slightly. I thought, i'd move to some kind of organizer-moments sharing service for tabletop games. From now on, this is going to be the main focus of the project.

## Installation & Running
- Rename .env.example into .env.docker. <br />
- Fill .env of your choice with your data. <br />
- You need to have Docker installed. <br />
- If you have it, run ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up``` <br />
- Voila!
