# STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

## Installation & Running
- Rename .env.example into .env.docker. <br />
- If you don't want to start this project in docker, but only have db, pgadmin and redis running there, create a .env file too. See .env.example for more details. <br />
- Fill .env of your choice with your data. <br />
- You need to have Docker installed. <br />
- If you have it, run ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up``` <br />
- Voila!
